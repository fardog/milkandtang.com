    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://timer.fardogllc.com">Timer</a> is a simple, multiple countdown timer web application. The iPhone lacks multiple timers, and what I found on the app store was poor. What I found online, also poor (and way too full of ads), so I built one. It's pretty simple, and hopefully you'll find it useful.</p>

<p>I've actually started some additional work on it—such as long-running timers that are remembered if you leave the site—but I'll probably come back to those some other day. Also this includes my newest pre-deployment processing scripts, which perform automatic minification and building from <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">jinja</a> templates. They may be of interest to someone.</p>

<p>Timer's source is <a href="http://github.com/fardog/timer/">available on my github</a>. I would love to see some patches or improvements! Or, just enjoy as-is.</p>
