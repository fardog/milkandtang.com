<p>My old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Famicom">Sharp Twin Famicom</a> threw the belt again, as they do. While replacing it, I wanted to make an update to <a href="http://milkandtang.com/blog/2010/03/21/fixing-a-famicom-disk-system/">my previous blog post</a> about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Computer_Disk_System">FDS</a> belts, since my old article wasn&#8217;t as helpful as I&#8217;d have liked when I actually tried to use it.</p>

<p>First, there&#8217;s now a <a href="http://www.famicomdisksystem.com/tutorials/fds-repair-mod/belt-replacement-adjustment/">far better repair article</a> available at the <a href="http://www.famicomdisksystem.com/">Famicom Disk System</a> website. This goes through the whole process of belt replacement as well as aligning the spindle hub, which I had a lot of problem with this time.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d recommend following <a href="http://www.famicomdisksystem.com/tutorials/fds-repair-mod/belt-replacement-adjustment/">their article</a> over mine; it does a far better job of explaining how to align the spindle hub. The only addition I would make is that I still had to make small 5â€“10&deg; adjustments both forward and backward to the spindle hub before everything worked.</p>
