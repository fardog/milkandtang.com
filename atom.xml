    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/_primes_"><img src="http://milkandtang.com/media/2013-10-16_primes.png" alt="_primes_ Twitter avatar" /></a></p>

<p>A few weeks ago I started <a href="https://twitter.com/_primes_"><em>primes</em></a>, a Twitter-backed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number">prime number</a> generator. When I say &#8220;Twitter-backed&#8221;, I mean the bot that updates the account has very little idea of state: it only knows the last number it calculated because Twitter provides it. The program flow is this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start up</li>
<li>Fetch the most recently calculated prime from the Twitter feed.</li>
<li>Calculate the next prime.</li>
<li>Post if an hour has passed since the last posting. Wait if not, then post.</li>
<li>Steps 2–4 forever.</li>
</ol>


<p>Technically steps two and four are merged after the first posting, since Twitter returns your latest tweet as a response when you post it. You can <a href="http://github.com/fardog/_primes_">view the code</a> on Github. It&#8217;s written in CoffeeScript on Node.js, and uses <a href="https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers">node-fibers</a> since I orginally built the prime number algorithm as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generator_(computer_programming)">generator</a>, but it&#8217;s unnecessary in this case.</p>

<p>The only state the application maintains is an internal &#8220;last posting&#8221; date, just as a fail-safe if the server it runs on spontaneously changed time: I didn&#8217;t want it accidentally posting too quickly.</p>

<p>You should give it a follow if you love primes! Or maybe <a href="http://github.com/fardog/_primes_">fork the code</a> and make some new Twitter bots? I&#8217;d love to see some.</p>

    <id>http://milkandtang.com/blog/2013/10/08/an-addendum-to-fixing-a-famicom-disk-system</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Famicom">Sharp Twin Famicom</a> threw the belt again, as they do. While replacing it, I wanted to make an update to <a href="http://milkandtang.com/blog/2010/03/21/fixing-a-famicom-disk-system/">my previous blog post</a> about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Computer_Disk_System">FDS</a> belts, since my old article wasn&#8217;t as helpful as I&#8217;d have liked when I actually tried to use it.</p>

<p>First, there&#8217;s now a <a href="http://www.famicomdisksystem.com/tutorials/fds-repair-mod/belt-replacement-adjustment/">far better repair article</a> available at the <a href="http://www.famicomdisksystem.com/">Famicom Disk System</a> website. This goes through the whole process of belt replacement as well as aligning the spindle hub, which I had a lot of problems with this time.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d recommend following <a href="http://www.famicomdisksystem.com/tutorials/fds-repair-mod/belt-replacement-adjustment/">their article</a> over mine; it does a far better job of explaining how to align the spindle hub. The only addition I would make is that I still had to make small 5–10&deg; adjustments both forward and backward to the spindle hub before everything worked.</p>

    <link href="http://milkandtang.com/blog/2013/08/27/getting-wifi-on-a-headless-raspberry-pi/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-27T11:38:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://milkandtang.com/blog/2013/08/27/getting-wifi-on-a-headless-raspberry-pi</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the final steps in a to-be-announced project involved getting a headless <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> up on WiFi at boot time—which turned out to be a little more challenging that first expected. Not because it was particularly difficult, but because the documentation was poor.</p>

<p>Below are my full configuration files that were required. The WiFi USB dongle itself was an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/1030">Adafruit USB WiFi with Antenna</a> which is actually a B-LINK BBL-LW05-AR5; notable becuase of its sizeable antenna, and for working with the latest Raspbian Wheezy distribution.</p>

<p>Prior to getting started, make sure your Raspbian is up to date by issuing:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>sudo apt-get update
</span><span class='line'>sudo apt-get upgrade
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>At that point, reboot and connect your WiFi module to USB. Then, edit your config. It&#8217;s worth noting that I have an interface <code>eth0</code> which is set to DHCP, and my <code>wlan0</code> interface which has a static IP. This allows me to use ethernet as a failsafe if something goes wrong.</p>

<p>First, in the file <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>auto lo
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>iface lo inet loopback
</span><span class='line'>iface eth0 inet dhcp
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>allow-hotplug wlan0
</span><span class='line'>iface wlan0 inet manual
</span><span class='line'>wpa-roam /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>iface YOUR_WIFI_ID inet static
</span><span class='line'>address 192.168.1.5
</span><span class='line'>netmask 255.255.255.0
</span><span class='line'>gateway 192.168.1.1
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># iface default inet dhcp</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is setting up your ethernet to dhcp, your wifi to manual, sourcing the <code>wpa_supplicant.conf</code> file, and then assigning your named Wireless connection to a static IP. Note that <em>YOUR_WIFI_ID</em> above should be an identifier you make up yourself. For example, mine is <em>NORTH_WPA</em>.</p>

<p>Now, configure the network information in <code>/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">ctrl_interface</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">DIR</span><span class="o">=</span>/var/run/wpa_supplicant <span class="nv">GROUP</span><span class="o">=</span>netdev
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># update_config=1</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">network</span><span class="o">={</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nv">ssid</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;Your SSID Name&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nv">proto</span><span class="o">=</span>RSN
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nv">key_mgmt</span><span class="o">=</span>WPA-PSK
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nv">pairwise</span><span class="o">=</span>CCMP TKIP
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nv">group</span><span class="o">=</span>CCMP TKIP
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nv">psk</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;Your WPA Password&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nv">id_str</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;YOUR_WIFI_ID&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Again, note that <em>YOUR_WIFI_ID</em> is present.</p>

<p>At that point, reboot. Assuming you&#8217;ve got all your information correct (and that your key management and etc. match mine) you&#8217;ll be connected automatically at boot!</p>

<p>Much of the information in this post was gleaned from <a href="http://pingbin.com/2012/12/setup-wifi-raspberry-pi/">this thread</a>. The original poster&#8217;s information didn&#8217;t work for me, but I was able to assemble a working config from various commenters&#8217; information.</p>

<h4>UPDATE 2014-01-06</h4>

<p>When I switched from the older-style Airport Extreme base stations to the new &#8220;tower&#8221;-shaped base stations, I was having issues with the WiFi disconnected and then not reconnecting without a reboot. To resolve this, I followed one of the answers in <a href="http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/4120/how-to-automatically-reconnect-wifi">this stack exchange post</a>, reproduced below for convenience. This is originally from the user <a href="http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/users/6365/andaluz">AndaluZ</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Well, there is a very simple solution:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to <code>/etc/ifplugd/action.d/</code> and rename the <code>ifupdown</code> file to <code>ifupdown.original</code></li>
<li>Then do: <code>cp /etc/wpa_supplicant/ifupdown.sh ./ifupdown</code></li>
<li>Finally: <code>sudo reboot</code></li>
</ol>


<p>That&#8217;s all. Test this by turning off/on your AP; you should see that your Raspberry Pi properly reconnects.</p></blockquote>

The iPhone lacks multiple timers, and what I found on the app store was poor. What I found online, also poor (and way too full of ads), so I built one. It&#8217;s pretty simple, and hopefully you&#8217;ll find it useful.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve actually started some additional work on it—such as long-running timers that are remembered if you leave the site—but I&#8217;ll probably come back to those some other day. Also this includes my newest pre-deployment processing scripts, which perform automatic minification and building from <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">jinja</a> templates. They may be of interest to someone.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Part of this evening was spent making <code>vim</code> workable for me, the first step was getting some sane defaults. <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible">vim-sensible</a> was recommended in several places (as was Tim Pope&#8217;s also excellent <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">pathogen</a>), but immediately after installation I was getting an error:</p>

</span><span class='line'>Press ENTER or type command to continue</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Frustratingly, line 75 held no obvious suggestions. After some time troubleshooting, I found it worked fine if I wasn&#8217;t using <a href="http://www.ridiculousfish.com/shell/"><code>fish</code> shell</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not positive why this is the case, but you can fix the error by adding the following line to your <code>.vimrc</code>.</p>

<p>On next launch of <code>vim</code>, all is resolved.</p>

    <link href="http://milkandtang.com/blog/2013/03/06/the-new-yorker-and-the-importance-of-optimization/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-06T22:43:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://milkandtang.com/blog/2013/03/06/the-new-yorker-and-the-importance-of-optimization</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Update 2013-03-07: Please see the correction at the bottom of this article.</em></p>

<p>I have a small obsession web platforms, and discovering what platform a site is using. There are some <a href="http://guess.scritch.org/">great tools</a> that help, but nothing beats <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View-source_URI_scheme">viewing the source</a>. Recently I encountered the <em><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/">New Yorker</a></em>…</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a sight. I encourage you to check the source for yourself, but it&#8217;s a templating system gone wrong. The day I discovered it, I <a href="https://twitter.com/milkandtang/status/304454130448080897">tweeted</a>—</p>

<blockquote><p>in the midst of 90 new-lines, sits @NewYorker&#8217;s <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag. a scant 1006 lines later, the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.</p></blockquote>

<p>—to no reply. It&#8217;s for real though: their homepage serves, of this writing, <em>16101 newlines</em>. Many of their tags are surrounded by no less than 30 newlines each. Their <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> contains <em>998</em> alone. So this gets me thinking:</p>

<p>A newline character, usually represented as <code>\n</code> in many languages, but represented by the unicode <code>U+000A</code> tends to be represented as an 8-bit ASCII character, or one byte. For the purposes of this excercise we&#8217;ll assume exactly that.</p>

<p>In terms of websites:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://nytimes.com">The New York Times</a> sends 1419 newlines.</li>
<li><a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a> sends 236</li>
<li><a href="http://google.com">Google</a> sends 87</li>
<li><a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> sends 1 newline. One.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now lets talk bandwidth: 16101 bytes is 0.0153 MB—less than two-hundredths of a megabyte—it&#8217;s not much. Now traffic-wise: According to <a href="http://compete.com">Compete</a>, they see 1,103,088 unique visitors per month.</p>

<p>Or, if you prefer: <strong>16.54 GB of newlines per month</strong>, strictly in unique visits to the homepage. Hey, <a href="http://condenast.com">Condé Nast</a>: might be time to optimize?</p>

<p><strong>Correction:</strong> Reddit has <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/19u4ho/the_new_yorker_and_its_16gb_of_newlines/">bested me on this one</a>. As the commenters point out, my math is done assuming that the web server isn&#8217;t configured to compress with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip">gzip</a>—and it is. Since <a href="http://www.http-compression.com/">all major browsers support gzip</a>, the actual impact of <em>The New Yorker&#8217;s</em> excessive newlines is <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/19u4ho/the_new_yorker_and_its_16gb_of_newlines/c8rc6ie">minimal</a>.</p>

<p>So, this is more or less an article about the comical result of a templating system than it is about performance. Thanks to those on Reddit that pointed out this error.</p>

<p>This simply generates a sine wave of a specified frequency and length, and writes it out to an already open PyAudio stream. A pleasant tone is produced. It&#8217;s not too fancy, but it beats loading a wave file from disk.</p>

    <link href="http://milkandtang.com/blog/2013/02/15/simple-workon-command-for-fish-shell/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-15T00:15:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://milkandtang.com/blog/2013/02/15/simple-workon-command-for-fish-shell</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I put together a quick <code>workon</code> clone for the <a href="http://www.ridiculousfish.com/shell/">fish&#8217;s fish shell</a>. Definitely nothing as complete or useful as <a href="http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper/">virtualenvwrapper</a>, but it fixes my need: switching simply between virtualenv&#8217;s and projects.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>First, create a function file <code>~/.config/fish/functions/workon.fish</code> with this defintion:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
<span class='line-number'>17</span>
<span class='line-number'>18</span>
<span class='line-number'>19</span>
<span class='line-number'>20</span>
<span class='line-number'>21</span>
<span class='line-number'>22</span>
<span class='line-number'>23</span>
<span class='line-number'>24</span>
<span class='line-number'>25</span>
<span class='line-number'>26</span>
<span class='line-number'>27</span>
<span class='line-number'>28</span>
<span class='line-number'>29</span>
<span class='line-number'>30</span>
<span class='line-number'>31</span>
<span class='line-number'>32</span>
<span class='line-number'>33</span>
<span class='line-number'>34</span>
<span class='line-number'>35</span>
<span class='line-number'>36</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>function workon -d "Activate virtual environment in $WORKON_HOME"
</span><span class='line'>  set tgt {$WORKON_HOME}/$argv[1]
</span><span class='line'>  if [ -d $tgt ]
</span><span class='line'>    cd $tgt
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    # deactivate any active venv, and activate the target
</span><span class='line'>    # this needs to be rewritten with the `type` fish command
</span><span class='line'>    if test -n "$VIRTUAL_ENV"
</span><span class='line'>      deactivate
</span><span class='line'>    end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    . bin/activate.fish
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    if test (count $argv) -gt 1
</span><span class='line'>      if test $argv[2] = "open"
</span><span class='line'>        set -gx WORKON_OPEN_SUBLIME True
</span><span class='line'>      end
</span><span class='line'>    else
</span><span class='line'>      set -ge WORKON_OPEN_SUBLIME
</span><span class='line'>    end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    # open sublime text
</span><span class='line'>    if test -n "$WORKON_OPEN_SUBLIME"
</span><span class='line'>      open {$WORKON_SRC_DIR}/{$argv[1]}.sublime-project
</span><span class='line'>    end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    # change to working dir
</span><span class='line'>    if test -n "$WORKON_SRC_DIR"
</span><span class='line'>      cd {$WORKON_SRC_DIR}/{$argv[1]}
</span><span class='line'>    end
</span><span class='line'>  else
</span><span class='line'>    echo "$tgt not found"
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>complete -c workon -a "(cd $WORKON_HOME; ls -d *)"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then, define the necessary environment variables in your <code>~/.config/fish/config.fish</code> file:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>set -gx WORKON_HOME ~/Documents/virtual_environments
</span><span class='line'>set -gx WORKON_SRC_DIR ~/Documents/code
</span><span class='line'>set -gx WORKON_OPEN_SUBLIME True</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As you might imagine, this is set up for how I work, but it wouldn&#8217;t be difficult to customize for your needs. Since this uses the virtualenv-provided <code>activate.fish</code> script, the <code>deactivate</code> command works as expected, as well as any other usual functions.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://isthisdst.us">Is this Daylight Saving Time?</a> is a single-page site to determine your DST status. You can check out the source on <a href="https://github.com/fardog/isthisdst/">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s an overblown build—using <a href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a> for such a small site isn&#8217;t necessary—but it was more of an exercise than anything. The implementation is my first attempt at some best practices, namely <a href="http://fabfile.org">fabric</a> for automated deployment out of git, and <a href="https://github.com/cyberdelia/django-pipeline">pipeline</a> for css/script minification.</p>

<p>Other packages used include <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytz">pytz</a> for timezone calculations and <a href="https://github.com/boto/boto">boto</a> for automated upload of static assets to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">S3</a>. <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com">Zurb Foundation</a> was used for the frontend.</p>

<p>Geolocation is done using the City and Country IP databases from <a href="http://www.maxmind.com/en/geolocation_landing">MaxMind</a> and uses the Django-included <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/gis/geoip/">django.contrib.gis.geoip</a> to read them. That resolves the lat/long, which I then send to <a href="http://www.geonames.org/">GeoNames</a> for to get the timezone. That result is cached in a local SQLite database to minimize lookups to GeoNames.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a great learning experience. Like all great learning experiences it took entirely longer than I&#8217;d originally intended; all part of the fun.</p>

    <updated>2010-03-21T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://milkandtang.com/blog/2010/03/21/fixing-a-famicom-disk-system</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Update 2013-10-08:</strong> There is now a <a href="http://www.famicomdisksystem.com/tutorials/fds-repair-mod/belt-replacement-adjustment/">great article available</a> at the <a href="http://www.famicomdisksystem.com/">Famicom Disk System</a> site, which I&#8217;d highly recommend. See <a href="http://milkandtang.com/blog/2013/10/08/an-addendum-to-fixing-a-famicom-disk-system/">my addendum</a> for more info.</em></p>

<p>This isn’t the usual fare from this blog, but this is good information that took me quite some time to find. I’m also an avid video game collector, and i recently picked up a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Famicom">Sharp Twin Famicom</a> and a few <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Computer_Disk_System">Famicom Disk System</a> games; notably Kid Icarus and the infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doki_Doki_Panic">Doki Doki Panic!</a>, which later became the USA/World <em>Super Mario Brothers 2</em>.</p>

<p>Anyhow, my Twin Famicom came with Super Mario Brothers 2 (known as the Lost Worlds outside of Japan) which works perfectly, but the game on the back (some sort of Tennis game) wouldn’t ever work. I didn’t think much of it, until both of my new games didn’t work either. I would receive an Err.21 or Err.22 message each time I attempted to load the games. The drive would attempt to read, come to a full stop (<strong>note:</strong> this is important!) and then attempt to read again, shortly before throwing the error message.</p>

<p>So, my Twin Famicom came with a broken belt, which is very common, and the seller shipped the system with a new belt that would have to be <a href="http://www.pinkgorillagames.com/retro_reviews/simply_ness_guide_to_famicom_d.php">installed</a>. This part went swell, but apparently there’s more to be done. There’s a lot of <a href="http://www.digitpress.com/forum/showthread.php?t=140944">random forum posts</a> out there, telling you to adjust the potentiometer on the motor to adjust the drive speed, or the <a href="http://www.famicomworld.com/forum/index.php?topic=392.0">read head</a> on the disk drive. Adjusting the pot was simple, but didn’t give me any results, and the read head is factory set (and thoroughly waxed/glued in) and seemed a little too dangerous to adjust, so I didn’t want to try.</p>

<p>I found a lot of passing mentions to aligning the spindle, but no real good information on how to do so, until I came across this <a href="http://digitpress.com/forum/showpost.php?p=364900&amp;postcount=97">forum post</a> by “Zach”:</p>

<blockquote><p>The tough part (for me, at least) comes when you have to phyiscally align the drive. The first time I replaced a belt, the drive worked (without any alignment) for most of my games, but not some others.<br/>
[&#8230;]<br/>
So what you have to do is reach in from the front of the drive, loosen the SMALL black allen head set screw that holds the grey metal block to the spindle, then rotate the big gear with the belt slot around until it clicks (you’ll see the spring-loaded piece snap into place, dropping down a steep notch). At that point, you have to rotate the big gear another quarter turn. This is the position where you want the assembly to be when you have the little, black set screw pointing straight out the front of the drive, so line up the smal, grey metal disk pickup block (which should be free to spin around the spindle since the set screw is loose) , and tighten the set screw with your little allen wrench. Try it out and see if more disks are loading (or see if you’ve messed up the drive even more!)</p></blockquote>

<p>I followed his instructions by performing the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove the FDS drive from the system, and disassemble the following:

<ul>
<li>Front faceplate and drive door</li>
<li>Bottom Plate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Look inside the drive from the front (where the drive door was), and spin the spindle (from the gear at the bottom of the drive) until the small allen screw faces you.</li>
<li>Loosen the screw, and keep the allen key in the screw to hold the spindle still.</li>
<li>Spin the drive pulley clockwise until you hear a small click (clockwise should be observed by looking at the bottom of the drive. The spindle (if you were looking straight down at the top, would be moving counter-clockwise).</li>
<li>Once you hear the small click, spin one quarter turn clockwise, and tighten down the spindle (allen screw).</li>
</ol>


<p>I half reassembled things to see if the trick worked, and I was getting a new behavior! Now, the drive would spin up, attempt to read, and go to a black screen! The drive would continue spinning (and wouldn’t come to a full stop mid read, very important!), and then eventually the Famicom BIOS screen would return, with Err.27. I was on the way!</p>

<p>From here, I did the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Loosen spindle, and turn the pulley 5 degrees or so clockwise, then retighten the spindle.</li>
<li>Try a disk again.</li>
</ol>


<p>I repeated those steps until the drive began exhibiting somewhat similar behavior as before (coming to a full stop during the read operation). Then I did the same, only moving 5 degrees counter-clockwise instead; and you know what?</p>

<p><strong>IT WORKED.</strong></p>

<p>Stupid thing loaded. It turns out that the systems are aware of the spindle position, and if it isn’t correct it will cause them to read the header data incorrectly, causing the games to fail. Afterwards, I reassembled the system and all of my games have been loading flawlessly.</p>

<p>Someday in the future maybe I’ll turn this into a guide with pretty pictures and everything, but for now hopefully this’ll help someone get their FDS working.</p>

<p>For reference, here’s a list of FDS Error Codes:</p>

<blockquote><p>ERROR 01 Disk not correctly inserted. (No Disk Card)<br/>
ERROR 02 Battery error. Check power adaptor or batteries.<br/>
ERROR 03 Broken prong on disk card.<br/>
ERROR 04 Wrong gamemaker ID.<br/>

ERROR 08 Disk #1 wrong.<br/>
ERROR 09 Disk #2 wrong.<br/>
ERROR 10 Disk #3 wrong.<br/>
ERROR 20 screen data differs.<br/>

ERROR 24 File header block recognition #$03 can’t read and cant be ignored.<br/>
ERROR 25 File data block recognition #$04 can’t read and cant be ignored.<br/>
ERROR 26 Can’t save properly to disk card.<br/>
ERROR 27 Block end mark seen and ends prematurely.<br/>

ERROR 29 The disk unit and the same period can’t take it.<br/>
ERROR 30 Disk card too full to save.<br/>
ERROR 31 Data number of a disk card doesn’t match up.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then, a commenter named &#8220;Jon&#8221; posted the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>Thanks for posting this! When I got a “broken” FDS recently this helped direct me towards the cure.</p>

<p>I did find a much more direct &amp; accurate way to align these though. It can be done during belt replacement &amp; should eliminate the need for fine-tuning afterward.</p>

<p>How? When the gear assembly retainer (triangular piece) is removed for belt replacement, simply point the rectangular notch in the large white gear to the largest notch in the metal cam below it.</p>

<p>Maintain those positions during reinstall &amp; you should be good to go. No need to hunt for a hex key (1.5mm BTW) to adjust the disk catch on the spindle &amp; all positioning remains at original factory settings.</p></blockquote>
